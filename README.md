# World_Weather Analysis
An analysis of the PlanMyTrip app using Python with Pandas and Google/Weather APIâ€™s
## Overview of World_Weather_Analysis

After testing out the Plan my trip app in a Beta audience, they suggested a few modifications to the app. They wanted to see weather descriptions added to the weather data retrieved from the module. You can change this by having the audience input their weather data including preferred temperature. This will help to pinpoint exact locations and hotels based on the choices. They then can narrow down the choice to 4 cities and you can use google map to show their travel route. 
#### The below pseudocode provided us an outline for the analysis: 

1.	The weather data we need to retrieve.
2.	Create a customer travel destinations map
3.	Create a travel itinerary
